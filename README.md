## Going to Mars Steps

1. Some cats are not showing when they have been sold
   - deploy locally and sync from the later blocks (use satoshi's example)
   - 0x3dC56EF13e98E86F57B3251dF0aA8a2c62EfE1a1 and sold: 0x00e7f8751f
2. Enable to give cat on the front
3. Research adoption and decide how to integrate it
